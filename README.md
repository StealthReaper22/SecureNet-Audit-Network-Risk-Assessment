# SecureNet-Audit-Network-Risk-Assessment
In this simulated network security audit, I performed vulnerability scans using Nessus and analyzed packet captures with Wireshark. The goal was to identify system weaknesses and recommend mitigation strategies.

Key Tasks:

Conducted vulnerability scans on a sample network environment

Parsed and reviewed PCAP files with Wireshark to uncover potential threats

Created a security audit report with remediation steps based on risk levels

Tools Used:
Nessus, Wireshark, PCAP files, simulated network environment
